# AirBnB clone

## 0x06. AirBnB clone - Web dynamic

While we won’t be implementing every feature, we’ll focus on key functionalities that cover all the fundamental concepts we've been learning. Over the next four months, we’ll develop a complete web application that includes:

1. A Command Interpreter: To manipulate data without a visual interface, just like in a Shell—perfect for development and debugging.
2. A Website (Front-End): To showcase our final product to the world, with both static and dynamic elements.
3. Data Storage: Using either a database or files to store our data, which consists of objects.
4. [An API](https://github.com/Keamogetsw3/AirBnB_clone_v4): To create a communication interface between the front-end and our data, allowing us to retrieve, create, delete, and update information.
